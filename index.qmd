# About Me

I graduated from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) with a Bachelors of Science in Systems Biology and a minor in Chemistry in May 2023. I am currently pursuing an MS in Biomedical and Health Informatics from the CWRU School of Medicine. I am experienced in data analysis, statistical modeling, and computer programming in R, Python, and MATLAB. My passions include using data analytics to improve health outcomes, particularly for neonatal and pediatric patients. 

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:clp100@case.edu).
